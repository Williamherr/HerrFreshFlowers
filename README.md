# This was a project in	Web-Based Application Design and Development class. I created a website using HTML,CSS, and JS. This website was created for a flower business called Herr Fresh Flowers. I included a basic layout with a home, about, and contact page. I also include other pages like a flower page to see what flowers are available. 

How to open Herr Fresh Flowers:

1. Download or clone the project
2. Open the project with your favorite IDE (I use Visual Studio Code)
3. Run with a live Server (In VSC I installed an extension called live server. 
   Once the extenstion is installed, right click on the Home.html page and click run server)
