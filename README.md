# This was a project in	Web-Based Application Design and Development class. I created a website using HTML,CSS, and JS. This website was created for a flower business called Herr Fresh Flowers. I inlcuded a basic layout with a home, about, and contact page. I also include other pages like a flower page to see what flowers are available.
