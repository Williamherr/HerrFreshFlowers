        <div class="aboutText">
            <p>The year was 1988, when my wife, Shengying Yang, and I first met inside a refugee camp.  
                We were just teenagers when we had to begin our treacherous journey, only carrying the clothes on our backs to seek refuge from the Vietnam War.  
                It was soon afterward, in 1990, we were granted a visa to come to the United States of America where we soon settled in Fresno, California. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Living in the Americas, it was not always easy because we were born only knowing the Hmong language.  
                It was challenging at first, but we felt we were capable of achieving much more as we became more knowledgeable about the English language and the American lifestyle.  
                We eventually decided to move to Milwaukee, Wisconsin as we felt we had an opportunity to thrive since, at that time, the job industry was booming.

            <p>
                Our goals did not stop here, as we began to chase our “American Dream”.  We wanted to raise a family inside our own house while managing a business of our own.
                In the year 2000, we decided to move to Statesville, North Carolina along with our family of eight to start our very own floral business.  
                It began with renting land to growing our flowers to eventually moving to our current location in Vale, NC where we now have our garden.

            <p>
                
                Within our business, we have six greenhouses with two being fully functional, year-round.  
                We also have two large coolers to keep the flowers staying fresh and healthy after a long day in the garden.  
                With our passion for flowers, we hope to continue sharing our love for growing and making bouquets to our many customers here in Vale, North Carolina.
